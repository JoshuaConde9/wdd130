            <p>Hi my name is Joshua Conde, I'm from Colombia and I am 20 years old. I'm new to software development/programming/coding, but I am very excited to learn more. I like drawing, listening to music and learning languages (that's a big reason why I'm interested in this program).
            I recently returned from my mission in BelÃ©m, Brazil. It was an experience that helped me to learn a lot of new things about the gospel and life. My favourite part was being able to help and serve others.</p>

            <img src="images/colombia.jpg" alt="Colombia culture">
            <p>Colombia is a country in South America that is well known for its beautiful biodiversity, the kindness of the people, the food, and the production of coffee and emeralds. Tourists often visit this country to see the beautiful beaches both from the Atlantic and Pacific ocean, or to visit the Amazon rainforest or the Andes mountain range.</p>
