            <p>Hi my name is Joshua Conde, I'm from Colombia and I am 20 years old. I'm new to software development/programming/coding, but I am very excited to learn more. I like drawing, listening to music and learning languages (that's a big reason why I'm interested in this program).
            I recently returned from my mission in BelÃ©m, Brazil. It was an experience that helped me to learn a lot of new things about the gospel and life. My favourite part was being able to help and serve others.</p>
